# 

I'm Thomas Bourany. Currently student in the Research Master "Mathematics of Modelling", I specialize in control theory and numerical methods for Mean Field Games and their applications to economics.

Previously graduated from a master in Economics, I plan to start a PhD in Economics in September 2018. I am mainly interested in macroeconomics and the implications of agent heterogeneity for monetary and fiscal policies.
